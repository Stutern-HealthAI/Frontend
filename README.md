## Product Name: HealthAI

### Theme: AI-Powered Symptom and Diagnosis Guidance

### Product Scope:
The project aims to develop an application that facilitates symptom analysis and provides preliminary medical advice through an AI-powered chatbot. The focus is on creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to input symptoms using text or voice and receive quick, concise responses. The application will leverage the ChatGPT API to generate responses and prioritize accessibility and seamless interaction.

### Problem Statement:

In the current healthcare landscape, individuals face challenges in accessing timely and personalized health information. The traditional system often leads to delays, and there is a lack of user-friendly tools that leverage artificial intelligence for symptom analysis and preliminary medical advice. This gap results in reliance on unreliable sources or neglect of symptoms. The need is evident for a comprehensive solution like HealthAI, aiming to provide accessible, AI-powered guidance, and tap into technologies like image analysis and body sensors to enhance the user experience. The goal is to create a platform that empowers individuals to take a proactive role in managing their health.
Objectives
Improved Accessibility: Provide users with an easily accessible platform for obtaining preliminary medical advice.
Urgency Determination: Assist users in assessing the urgency of seeking in-person medical care based on the severity and nature of their symptoms.
Enhanced Communication: Offer users the flexibility to communicate with the chatbot through text, voice, or a combination of both.
Limitation Awareness: Increase user awareness regarding the limitations of AI-generated advice and emphasize the importance of consulting a medical professional for a comprehensive evaluation

### Use Cases:

Quick Symptom Assessment: Users can quickly assess their symptoms by describing them in their preferred language and communication type, receiving immediate preliminary advice.

Flexible Communication: The application accommodates users like Sam who prefer voice communication and users like Grace who prefer text, allowing seamless switching between the two.

User Feedback Integration: Users have the option to provide feedback on the advice received, allowing the chatbot to continually improve its responses and user interaction.

Supplementary Tool Awareness: The chatbot emphasizes that it is a supplementary tool and not a replacement for professional medical advice, promoting awareness of the limitations of AI-generated guidance.

Save and Share Functionality: Users can save their conversation history for personal records or share it with healthcare professionals, facilitating more informed in-person consultations.
